list of stuff i have to do/fix
- imgui: WantCaptureKeyboard to know if we need to handle input
- also integrate imgui
- in the load scene function (gl utils) update to use new instead of malloc (and cleanup the function)
- create uniform for the light in the shader
- frustum culling
- when we press q/e the up vector we use to change the yaw should rotate?
- load all meshes in scene as a single mesh?
- mouse camera movement
- we should link assimp dynamically
- in the mesh loading function, in the line 261, shouldn't it be GL_UINT???
- revise const correctness
- in the font atlas function, it should be possible to load custom ranges of characters before creating the texture atlas
- In glutils, when we load the indices and then bind the buffer we pass glfloat to glVertexAttribPointer, is this correct?
- the shader programme or the shaders are not being deleted right, it leaks memory if the programme gets deleted (see 2d text class destructor)
- implement kerning in the text rendering/atlas
- change the name of the texture coords in the character struct to left right top bottom or such
- create a shader class to avoid having to create a new shader for every object/text or whatever
- new lines in the 2d text class do not work when its not placed absolute to the bl, fix it or whatever
- integrate bullet 
- create a makefile that doesn't suck
